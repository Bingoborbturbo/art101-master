		  <h3>Challenges<h3>
			<p> We had issues with syntax errors and also with confusing methods/fnctions
		  <h3>Problems<h3>
			<p>One of the issues on the last part when declaring array.map was I kept putting isOdd instead of function(x) and it kept saying my squigles were wrong even though they werent
		  <h3>Results<h3>
			<p> We were able to create and run the script properly after fixing that and I included a picture of a donkey. We learned a lot about how arrays work since intially we tried tried doing something else [a,b,c,d] and set it too different values but we used another method
