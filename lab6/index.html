		<h3>Challenges<h3>
			<p>We were struggling organizing the array at the end of task 1 because instead of putting
				the elements we wanted the console log to return we kept putting [0] or [1] like for myTransport
				but it never worked but we figured it out.
		<h3>Problems<h3>
			<p>
				We struggled a little with syntax errors but we figured it out. Speficially with listing things and
				knowing when to put ; or , at the end of an element.
		<h3>Results<h3>
			  <p>As a result we were able to get our websites to work and the HTMl shows the script of our cars and their elements in the proper
				arrays
