	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The point of the lab was a bit confusing, but once we understood why we were using pseudocode, things got easier. </p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> We only had minor issues with this lab, the biggest being .css formatting issues, but some troubleshooting took care of those. Other than that, we didnâ€™t really run into any issues thankfully. One problem we faced is formatting  </p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
